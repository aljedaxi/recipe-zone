1. Prep and chop all the produce. Cut the butternut squash in half, then peel with a vegetable peeler. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard. Chop into even 1/2 inch cubes.
2. Set a large 7-8 quart saucepot over medium heat. Add the onions, chopped poblano peppers, and minced garlic. Sauté for 5 minute to soften.
3. Add in the cubed  butternut squash, rinsed beans, tomatoes, broth, green chiles in juices, frozen corn, and all spices. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, but save the cilantro for later.
4. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then uncover and simmer another 5 minutes to thicken. Once the squash is fork-tender, remove the bay leaf. Taste, then salt and pepper as needed. Stir in the cilantro and serve.

## Recipe Notes

Slow Cooker Instructions: Yes, you can make this is a crockpot! Sauté the onions, poblano peppers, and garlic on the stovetop. Then dump the veggies into a large 6+ quart slow cooker and add all remaining ingredients. Cover and cook on high for 2-4 hours, or on low for 5-7 hours.
Cooking Notes: Poblano chile peppers are mild and smoky. However, every once and a while you can stumble upon a spicier poblano. If you are worried about spicy heat, smell the poblanos as you chop them, then decide how much to add in.
