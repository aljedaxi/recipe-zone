## Pasta dough:
1. Mix the flour, semolina, and salt in a bowl. Heap to a pile and press a well into the center. Pour in water and olive oil and knead to a smooth dough with your hands.
2. Shape the dough into a ball or disc, wrap in cling foil and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
## Vegetable filling:
1. Peel and cut potatoes into cubes. Cook them in salted water until fork tender, about 20 minutes, depending on their size. Then drain, put back on the stove uncovered, so the excess liquid can evaporate.
2. Add thawed peas (and toasted pine nuts, if using). Mash everything using a potato masher, or a fork, or an immersion blender.
3. Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the onion for 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and spinach and sauté 1-2 minutes longer until the spinach is wilted. Let cool slightly and squeeze well to remove excess liquid. (Optionally, use frozen spinach. Just thaw, squeeze and combine with roasted onions & garlic).
4. Chop the spinach mixture coarsely and add it along with the vegan cream cheese to the mashed potatoes. Mix everything together, season with nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper to taste.
## To make Ravioli Pockets (see step-by-step pics in the text above):
1. Roll out the prepared pasta dough thinly into a long rectangle on a lightly floured surface using a rolling pin (or use a pasta machine, if you have one).
2. Spread the filling over the rolled out pasta dough, leaving a (0.7-inch) border around the edges. Brush the border with a little water and roll it up into a long wrap. The seam-side should be down.
3. Divide the wrap into 6-8 equal pieces and press the dough down carefully (I used the handle of a wooden spoon to do that). Then cut the pieces using a pizza cutter (or sharp knife), making sure to seal the sides. (At this point you can either continue with this recipe or freeze them for another day.)
4. Bring salted water or vegetable broth to a boil in a large pot. Let the ravioli pockets slide in and simmer (don’t cook!) for approx. 15 minutes until done. Then remove with a slotted spoon and drain.
5. Now you can serve them just cooked in vegetable soup or with a sauce or pesto or roast them crispy in a pan.
## Crispy Roasted Ravioli:
1. Heat the vegan butter or oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cooked and drained Ravioli Pockets and pan-fry for about 5 minutes from all sides until golden brown and crispy.
2. Garnish with fresh herbs and pine nuts. Serve with with garlic mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes, or other veggies.
3. Enjoy!

## Recipe Notes

To make GLUTEN-FREE pasta dough, you can use a gluten-free flour blend.
Instead of dairy-free cream cheese or cashew ricotta, you can also use tofu feta, parmesan or any other grated dairy-free cheese.
You can also turn this recipe into a smaller ravioli (click here for the instructions) or using a ravioli form (click here for the instructions).
I recommend cooking this ravioli immediately when they’re ready in shape (or freeze for later), but if you want to cook them later, you should cover them with a damp towel, otherwise, they will get dry.
You can put frozen Ravioli straight from the freezer in boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes. It’s not necessary to defrost them!
