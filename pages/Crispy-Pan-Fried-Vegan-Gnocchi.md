## 
1. Fill a pot with water. Cut the potatoes in half. Add to the pot and boil until tender for about 15-20 minutes. Alternatively, you can pierce the potatoes 3 times with a fork and bake at 400°F/204°C but this takes twice as long.
2. While still hot and holding with a kitchen towel, carefully peel the white potato first. Add to a bowl and mash with a fork to remove lumps. Season with 1/2 tsp salt, then gradually mix in 4 tbsps (40g) flour until it comes together in a light but non-sticky dough.
3. Next place the dough on a floured surface, flatten slightly with your palm or roll into a log. Cut the dough into about 48 equal pieces.
4. Form each piece into a ball, coating the pieces with extra flour to prevent sticking.
5. Optional step: Roll the dough balls on a gnocchi board or back of a fork to get the signature pattern.
6. Repeat steps with the sweet potato, adding more or less flour as needed.
## Pan-frying Gnocchi
1. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil or vegan butter in a large skillet. Add mushrooms and broccoli and cook until mushrooms are browned.
2. Remove from the pan and add the remaining oil. Add gnocchi and spread in an even layer. Cook until they are golden brown at the bottom, which will be about 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Next, flip them and add rosemary, garlic and basil and continue to cook until they are brown and crispy all over.
4. Toss in broccoli and mushrooms and season to taste. Remove from heat and serve immediately.

## Recipe Notes

You can use any other brown mushrooms in this recipe. 
Store uncooked gnocchi in a container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Be sure they are coated well with flour so they don’t stick together. 
For longer storage, place on a baking sheet, spaced apart and freeze for an hour. Then place them in a container and store in the freezer for up to 2 months.
