# lacto-chips and lacto-fries

Imagine healthy potato chips or French fries… well, here they are. While conducting research in Peru on how the Quechua detoxify potatoes, I learned to make tocosh, a fermented potato food that is a staple in their traditional diet. The Quechua ferment whole potatoes in underground pits for months to detoxify them. The following recipe uses a variation on this process that shortens fermentation time by peeling and cutting the potatoes into fries or slicing them into chips. This increases the surface area while decreasing mass, helping the effects of the fermentation penetrate more quickly. Here’s how this process makes potatoes a safer, healthier, more nutritious food:

1. Peeling the potatoes drastically reduces toxins.

2. Fermenting continues to lower the toxins and enhance digestibility.

3. Fermenting provides a pleasant sour flavor reminiscent of salt and vinegar chips.

4. Fermenting reduces the carbohydrates, making it a lower-glycemic food.

5. Reducing the carbohydrates through fermentation also diminishes the Maillard reaction; this is what happens when the sugars come in contact with high heat, producing browning on chips and fries. This is important because the Maillard reaction in these foods can produce dangerous carcinogenic acrylamides.

Simply by including a fermentation step and frying in high-quality animal fat, we can transform an unhealthy junk food into a safe and nourishing food that I am proud to feed my family. While this is a somewhat labor-intensive process, it’s well worth it. When you make the fries, make a double batch and freeze half so you can grab a handful from the freezer and throw them directly into the deep fryer for an easy, last-minute side.

## Ingredients
- ½ cup sea salt, plus more for seasoning
- 3 pounds potatoes (such as russet and/or sweet potatoes)
- 2 quarts animal fat (such as lard or tallow)

To make the brine, pour 1 gallon water into a large fermentation container and add the salt. Stir to combine and dissolve the salt. Set the brine aside.

Fill a large bowl with water. Peel the potatoes. As soon as each potato is peeled, place it in the bowl of water so that it does not oxidize while you are peeling the rest. Once all of the potatoes are peeled, use a food processor, mandoline, or sharp knife to slice them to a thickness of 1⁄16 to ⅛ inch.

Put the sliced potatoes in the brine. Make sure the water level is no less than 1 inch from the top of the vessel so that it doesn’t overflow during fermentation. Cover the container with a cloth or lid that is not screwed on too tightly and set aside at room temperature to ferment. Fermentation, visible by the production of bubbles, should begin in a day or two. I usually ferment for a total of 3 to 5 days, depending on the temperature (less time if warmer, more if cooler) and on the desired flavor.

Pour the animal fat into a deep fryer or large, heavy pot and heat to 300°F.

While the fat is heating, drain the potato slices in a colander and rinse thoroughly several times. Spread out the slices in a single layer on a cooling rack or dish towel so that the moisture evaporates from the surface. If necessary, blot the tops with a towel. It is important to remove as much moisture as possible from the surface of the potato slices to prevent splattering when frying.

Once the fat is at 300°F and the surfaces of the potato slices are relatively dry, deep-fry in batches for 5 to 7 minutes, until the desired crispiness is achieved. Do not expect them to brown as much as regular potato chips.

Transfer the chips to a wire rack, crumpled-up brown paper, or paper towels, immediately sprinkle with salt, and toss to distribute. The chips can be eaten as soon as they cool or stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
