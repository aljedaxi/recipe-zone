# ASH SALT

Making ash salt from vegetable ends, stems, and skins is a great way to make use of leftovers and support a zero-waste approach in your kitchen. Onions, garlic, leeks, and other alliums, as well as celery and carrots, make fantastic choices. Use the ash salt whenever you want a little extra flavor and character; it is particularly good on meat and vegetables. One note: Some studies have found that grilling meat can produce a carcinogen known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and cooking starchy foods like potatoes at high temperatures produces acrylamides, also carcinogens. However, this doesn’t seem to be an issue when charring plant materials and vegetables to render charcoal or ash.

Preheat the oven to 500°F with a rack in the top position.

Arrange the vegetable scraps in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 1 to 2 hours, until the vegetables are completely charred.

Fully cool the vegetable scraps. Pulverize them in a spice grinder or blender and sift through a fine-mesh sieve. Mix with an equal volume of salt. Store in an airtight container at room temperature, up to several months.
