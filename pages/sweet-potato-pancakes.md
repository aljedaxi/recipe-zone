## 
1. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together all dry ingredients (all purpose flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon). Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
2. Stir together the wet ingredients in a small mixing bowl. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the well, mixing with a wooden spoon to combine. Don't overmix; it's okay if a few lumps remain.
3. Lightly grease a medium skillet with nonstick spray. Place on the stove over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup pancake mixture at a time, smoothing to make round circles as needed. Flip the pancakes when the tops start bubbling, or when sufficiently browned.
4. Enjoy with maple syrup, walnuts, or coconut cream. Store refrigerated in a closed container for 2-3 days. Reheats best on the stove at medium-low heat.

## Recipe Notes

Sweet potato puree: One medium to large sweet potato yeilds about 1 cup of mashed or pureed sweet potato. Do not puree the sweet potato skin. For best results, I recommend pureeing the sweet potato in a blender. This will make the sweet potato much easier to mix into the batter.
How to roast sweet potatoes: roast a medium sweet potato in a 425 degree oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour. It will be done when it's sizzling with juices and soft in the middle.
Non-dairy milk: Choose your favorite unsweetened, unflavored non-dairy milk. I use soy milk for its creaminess and flavor, but almond or oat milk will also work.
How to freeze pancakes: Vegan pancakes can be frozen for up to three months. To freeze, let the cooked pancakes cool to room temperature before stacking in a freezer-safe container (I love these freezer-safe glass containers).
