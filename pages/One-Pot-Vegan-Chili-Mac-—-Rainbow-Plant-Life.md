## 
1. In a Dutch oven (or a large nonstick soup pot), heat the 1 tablespoon oil (or 1/3 cup water) over medium heat. Once the oil is hot (or once the water is simmering), add the onions and cook for 2 minutes, seasoning with a pinch of salt. Add the garlic, mushrooms, and crumbled tempeh,  and cook for 5 more minutes. Add the chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt. Stir the spices into the vegetables and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant.
2. Pour in the vegetable broth to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot.
3. Add in the beans, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, and pasta. Stir well to combine.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through.
5. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in the agave or other sweetener. Taste for seasonings again and adjust accordingly.
6. If using vegan cheese, sprinkle it all over the top of the chili mac. Cover the lid and let warm through for a few minutes. Allow chili mac to rest at least 15 minutes before serving and top with fresh chopped cilantro and any other desired toppings.

## Recipe Notes

* See notes on “oil-free” in the blog post for an oil-free substitution.  
** See notes on “Tips for this recipe” on how to crumble tempeh. 
*** To add more heat, I recommend sautéing some jalapeño peppers or a serrano pepper along with the garlic. I find that this method, instead of just adding more cayenne pepper, yields a more balanced spiciness. 
*** The sweetness helps balance the spices and take some of the edges off from the heat.
