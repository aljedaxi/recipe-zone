## 
1. Peel the baby-onions and eliminate the tops and tails, but otherwise leave whole. Additionally top and tail the baby-carrots.
2. Heat the oil in a large-pan then  add the mushrooms, baby onions and baby carrots.
3. Cook over a moderate heat for 5-10minutes, adding the garlic for the past few minutes of cooking time. The mushrooms must be tender and ought to have released their juices. The carrots and onions will nonetheless be rather hard.
4. Add the red-wine and turn the heat. Simmer for a couple of minutes, then add the remaining ingredients. Mix well to blend.
