## Recipe Notes

Jamaican Rice and Peas With Coconut Milk Tips


This frugal side dish is often found with chicken, oxtails or fish but can pair well with just about everything.
To keep this dish lighter in calories, I make this with light coconut milk instead of regular coconut milk and coconut oil, as some other recipes may call for.
You can make this with white rice but if you prefer you can make it with brown rice. But you will need to cook it for longer and with more stock.
If you’re looking to make this strictly vegan or vegetarian, make sure to use vegetable stock not chicken stock as both are listed as options.
This can be a simple dump and start recipe for the stovetop or the rice cooker, but do NOT forget to stir it all together so the seasonings get to flavor all of the ingredients, not just one place.
