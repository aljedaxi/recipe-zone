# Italian-Style Zucchini and Chickpea Sauté

This colorful, classic Italian side dish features a saucy medley of fork-tender veggies. Look for 6- to 7-inch zucchini with a vibrant green color for best results: Large zucchini tend to have more seeds and less flavor.

---

- 1 onion, chopped (1 cup)
- 1 large red bell pepper, chopped (1 cup)
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 3 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut into ¼-inch slices (4 cups)
- 1 15-oz. can chickpeas, rinsed and drained (1½ cups)
- 1 cup oil-free marinara sauce
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
- 8 to 10 fresh basil leaves, chopped

Heat an extra-large skillet over medium. Add the first five ingredients (through thyme); cook 10 minutes, stirring often and adding water, 1 to 2 Tbsp. at a time, as needed to prevent sticking.

Add zucchini; cook 10 minutes more or until zucchini is tender. Stir in chickpeas, marinara sauce, and vinegar. Season with salt and black pepper. Heat through. Serve immediately garnished with basil.
