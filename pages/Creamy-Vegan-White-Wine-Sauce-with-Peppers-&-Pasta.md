## 

- *1.5 cups* homemade cashew milk (NOT storebought! See NOTE below)
- *8 oz* Brown rice spaghetti pasta OR pasta of choice
- *2* red bell peppers, sliced in 1/2 inch strips (350g) OR any veggies you like
- *0.5* heaping cup (80g) finely chopped white onion
- *3* large cloves garlic, minced (8g)
- *0.75 teaspoon* salt, separated
- *0.25 teaspoon* black pepper
- *0.75 cup* water, separated
- *0.25 cup* + 2 tablespoons (90g) white wine chardonnay
- *1 tablespoon* freshly chopped green onions (can use dried if you don't have fresh)
- *1 teaspoon* dried Italian spice blend (store-bought or my homemade blend)
- I use this scale.

## NOTE

- This recipe will ONLY work by using my homemade cashew milk. This is what thickens the sauce beautifully and makes it so rich and creamy. Store-bought is mostly fillers and sadly, WILL NOT work. To make the cashew milk, add 1/2 cup (75g) raw cashews and 1 1/2 cups filtered water and blend in a Vitamix until completely smooth. No need to drain. It will yield the BEST creamy results. If you are allergic to nuts, you can try canned "lite" coconut milk with 1 tbsp brown rice flour whisked in and I would omit the 1/4 cup water listed. I have not tested this, but it is my best suggestion.

## 
1. Have the cashew milk made before beginning the recipe.
2. Bring a pot of water to boil. Put the lid on and it will come to a boil faster. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 400Â°F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Add the bell pepper strips and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
3. Once the water is boiling, add a couple of teaspoons of salt, slowly to the boiling water and add your pasta. Stir well. The salt is important to flavor your pasta so it doesn't taste bland. Give it a good stir to break up the noodles.
4. Add your bell peppers to the preheated oven and cook for 10-15 minutes until tender, yet still firm.
5. Meanwhile, prepare your sauce. To a large sauce pan, add the onion, garlic, only 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, pepper and ONLY 1/2 cup water at this time. Give it a stir and turn the heat to medium. Once it is simmering, cook for about 5 minutes until the onions are tender, stirring a couple of times during. Check your pasta water.
6. Add the wine to the garlic/onion mixture and cook a couple of minutes to burn off some of the alcohol and it's reduced some, not all of it. Note: The longer you cook the wine, the less pronounced the flavor will be.
7. Add the premade cashew milk, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 cup water (omit the water if using the canned lite coconut milk version), green onions and Italian spice. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir and cook 5-10 minutes, stirring often, until it has thickened up to a nice creamy sauce. Taste and add any needed salt or pepper.
8. Serve with cooked pasta and bell peppers. Pour enough sauce so you really taste it and not just noodles. Makes 1 1/2 cups sauce. I think this sauce would be really good on potatoes too.
