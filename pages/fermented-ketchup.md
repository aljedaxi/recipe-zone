# FERMENTED KETCHUP

My first taste of archaeology happened when I was a kid and my father unearthed a bunch of very cool old bottles while digging up our front yard to fix a water pipe leak. We later discovered that these tiny bottles were ketchup bottles from E. C. Hazard and Company, which once existed on the same spot. At its peak at the turn of the 20th century, Hazard generated annual revenues between $7 and $9 million and even helped introduce Tabasco sauce to the world. Hazard’s “Shrewsbury Tomatoketchup” recipe, which was eventually sold to Heinz, was fermented, which explains why ketchup in the mid-1800s was seen as a healthy food. Unfortunately, commercial ketchup is no longer fermented and instead is preserved through chemicals and heat and loaded with high-fructose corn syrup and other refined sweeteners. This story illustrates the glaring difference between tomato ketchup consumption in the past and now; in the past, ketchup contained healthy, fermented ingredients, and the bottles were small, suggesting that people consumed small amounts at any given time. I have developed this recipe in the same spirit. My kids love it, and I feel good serving it to them.
