## Recipe Notes

Instant Pot Haitian Rice And Beans Notes: 
Which beans can you use to make Haitian rice and beans? You can use red kidney beans and black beans to make this dish. Haitian rice and beans can also be made with sweet peas too. I personally love it with black beans and served with fish. 
If you cooked the beans in the IP for the time suggested, and the beans still turn out hard, cook it again on high pressure for additional 5-10 minutes depending on how soft/hard the beans are. Sometimes when making I make beans over the stove, to expedite the cooking, I would add ½ teaspoon of baking soda. This helps the beans to cook faster – something I learned growing up.
Can you use vegetable broth to make the rice and beans? Absolutely. However, you may not get that “traditional” color Haitian rice usually have. Adding vegetable or chicken broth will only enhance the flavor further. It does not hurt to try it. Be mindful, to keep it as authentic as possible, water is best as we do not usually use vegetable or chicken stock/broth when making our meals. Such broths or stocks are used when it is directly from cooking meat or vegetables. 
Not all beans are created equally. I used small red beans because it is my personal preference. However, if using kidney beans, pinto, or black beans, the cooking time may vary.
