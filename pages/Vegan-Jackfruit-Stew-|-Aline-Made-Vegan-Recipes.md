## Recipe Notes

How long does this vegan stew stay fresh? Stored in an airtight container in your refrigerator, it stays fresh for 3-4 days. 
Can I use another vegetable instead of carrots? Yes, celery or potatoes also go very well with jackfruit stew.
Can I omit the red wine? No, red wine plays a vital role in this recipe and cannot be replaced.
What is the best red wine for this stew? I always use a Tempranillo red wine because of its slightly sweet flavor. Make sure not to use a very sour wine, as the jackfruit already has a somewhat sour note.
Can I skip the vegan Worcestershire sauce? This sauce gives the stew a pleasant aroma. But if you don’t have any, you can omit it or replace it with some soy sauce.
