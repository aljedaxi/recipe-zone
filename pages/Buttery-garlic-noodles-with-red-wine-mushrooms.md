## 
1. Follow package directions for cooking pasta.
2. While the pasta is boiling, bring a non-stick skillet to a medium heat with one teaspoon oil.
3. Add sliced mushrooms to the skillet in an even layer with a pinch of salt. Allow them to brown and release their liquid. For perfectly browned mushrooms, don't move them too much. Let them stay in one place, allowing consistent heat, before flipping them over. Test one mushroom to see if it has the perfect color, and when it's ready, flip the rest of them.
4. After the mushrooms have browned all over, scoot them to one side of the skillet. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Put the minced garlic in the oil. Saut√© for a few minutes until softened and fragrant. Then incorporate the garlic with the mushrooms.
5. Add red wine to deglaze the pan and pick up any crusty bits sticking to the pan. Let the mushrooms soak up the red wine. Stir until combined and all of the wine has soaked into the mushrooms.
6. Add 2 Tablespoons of vegan butter to the mushrooms until melted, and the mushrooms are glistening.
7. When the noodles are al dente, drain the pasta.
8. Add the drained pasta to the skillet along with the remaining Tablespoon of vegan butter. Stir to combine everything, so that it's evenly incorporated.
9. Top with chives, freshly ground pepper, and more salt, to taste. Then serve.

## Recipe Notes

*I recommend cremini or button mushrooms. However, oyster mushrooms are a delicious indulgence. If you're using oyster mushrooms, don't slice them. Just remove any hard parts at the stem, then cook as directed above.
This pasta is especially nice topped with crispy vegan chick'n strips, cooked in the air fryer or oven. I recommend Trader Joe's chickenless strips or Gardein tenders.
