# AVI’S TRADITIONAL HUMMUS

This recipe was shared with me by my friend, the Israeli chef Avi Mor Mosseri, whom I met at the Italian Culinary Institute. Avi was the first chef to introduce me to the advantages of adding baking soda to the soaking water for beans. This is hands down the best hummus recipe I have ever found. The tahini paste (made from sesame seeds) has been replaced by sunflower butter to drastically reduce the oxalate content in the hummus.

Avi explained to me that dry chickpeas oxidize and deteriorate very quickly when cooked, and even more quickly when mashed to a paste. This is why hummus is best when served warm, right after preparation. It may be kept cold for only one more day. Serious hummus restaurants in the Middle East prepare it fresh to serve, and many of them cook the daily portion of the chickpeas for the day’s sale and close the shop when sold and finished. This is why a truly good hummus is hard to get anywhere—so why not simply make it at home?

## Ingredients
- 2 cups soaked and cooked chickpeas, drained when still warm (see here)
- ½ cooked onion from cooking the chickpeas
- 1 garlic clove, peeled
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- ½ cup sunflower butter
- 1 cup warm water, as necessary
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Finely chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Combine the chickpeas, onion, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice in a food processor and process until very smooth. Add the sunflower butter and process until smooth. If the paste is too thick, add the warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, processing in between additions, until the desired consistency is reached. The hummus should be stable and not liquidy; if it turns too liquidy, balance it by adding more sunflower butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve warm, topped with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some finely chopped parsley, along with crackers for spreading.

Appendix: Cooking beans and chickpeas:

When we soak beans or chickpeas overnight in an alkaline solution created by adding baking soda to water, the final product is as safe and nourishing as possible. In much the same way that nixtamalization does with maize (see Chapter 5), this process detoxifies the antinutrients in the chickpeas and makes the nutrients more bioavailable. Soaking in an alkaline solution also reduces the cooking time and improves the texture by breaking down the pectin more quickly and thoroughly.

**MAKES ABOUT 6 CUPS**

- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 4 cups water
- 2 cups dry beans or chickpeas
- 1 onion, halved
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled

Combine the baking soda and water in a large bowl and stir to dissolve. Add the beans or chickpeas and cover the bowl. Soak for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.

Drain the beans or chickpeas in a colander, rinse well, and transfer to a medium pot. Add the onion, garlic, and enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook until soft. This may take 1 to 3 hours, depending on the variety, size, and age of the beans, as well as the humidity in your kitchen. Add water as needed to ensure that the beans are always covered with water. Alternatively, cook the beans with enough water to cover, the onion, and garlic cloves in a pressure cooker for 30 to 40 minutes.

If you plan on using the chickpeas to make Avi’s Traditional Hummus (here) or the beans to make Refried Beans (here), it is critical for them to be very soft—they should crush easily when pressed between your fingers.
