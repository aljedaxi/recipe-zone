# Slow Cooker Ratatouille


Chop up eggplant, zucchini, Roma tomatoes, bell pepper, and onion, throw them into the slow cooker with seasonings and tomato sauce, and come back in 5 hours for a mouthwatering stew. While it is not necessary, a quick stir halfway through cooking ensures the vegetables stay evenly moist. If you don’t have wheat berries or cannot eat gluten, serve the stew with another cooked whole grain, such as brown rice or quinoa, or enjoy it on its own.
