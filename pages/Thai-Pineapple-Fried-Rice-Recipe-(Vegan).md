## 
1. I like the Thai pineapple fried rice best with left-over rice from the day before.  So cook the rice according to the instructions on the package and store it in an air-tight container in the fridge until you use it. Cook the frozen peas for about 7 minutes.
2. In a large pan, heat the oil and sauté the onion for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic, the carrots, and the bell pepper. Cook for 3 minutes.
3. Then stir in the cooked rice and season with the curry powder and the soy sauce. Next, add the pineapple, the peas, the green onion, and the cashews. Season with salt, black pepper, and if using red pepper flakes. Stir until well combined. Serve with fresh cilantro. Enjoy!

## Recipe Notes

This Thai fried pineapple rice is best when you use left-over rice from the day before. Unlike freshly cooked rice, chilled leftover rice doesn't clump together or become mushy when being fried. 
Make sure the pineapple you use for this recipe is ripe. Check out this article that tells your more about how to find out if a pineapple is ripe. 
For a gluten-free version use tamari instead of soy sauce. 
If you want you can also add some protein to this pineapple fried rice. I saw that they sometimes add chicken or shrimps in Thailand. My vegan suggestions are fried tofu or tempeh. 
Prep all ingredients before you start the actual cooking process. The fried rice comes together super quickly, so you won't have much time for chopping once you've started cooking. 
If you're looking for a healthier version, you can also substitute the white basmati rice with brown rice. This would also be a good choice for people suffering from diabetes as brown rice has a way better glycemic index. 
This recipe works best in a wok or in a cast iron skillet.
