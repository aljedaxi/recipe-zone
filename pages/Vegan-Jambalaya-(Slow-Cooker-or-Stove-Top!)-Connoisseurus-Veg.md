## Slow Cooker Method
1. Place oil, pepper, celery, onion, garlic, tomatoes, 4 cups of broth, paprika, cumin, black pepper, thyme, oregano and hot sauce into slow cooker set to low heat.
2. Cover and cook for 4-5 hours, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the rice and raise the heat to high.
4. Stir, cover and cook for another hour to an hour and a half, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender and all liquid is absorbed. Add more broth if the rice becomes too dry during cooking.
5. Add beans and sausage. Stir and cook another 2 minutes or so, until beans and sausage are heated throughout.
6. Served topped with scallions.
## Stove Top Method
1. Coat the bottom of a large pot with oil and place over medium heat. When the oil is hot add bell pepper, celery, onion, and garlic. Saut√© for 5 minutes, until veggies are softened.
2. Add tomatoes, 4 cups of broth, paprika, cumin, black pepper, thyme, oregano, hot sauce, and rice. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and allow to simmer until the rice is cooked and liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to sit for about 5 minutes, covered.
3. If using vegan sausage, briefly heat it on the stove or in the microwave while the rice sits.
4. Remove lid, fluff rice with a fork, and stir in the beans and sausage. Serve topped with scallions.

## Recipe Notes

Nutrition information does not include vegan sausage, since there's so much variation among brands.
