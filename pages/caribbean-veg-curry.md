1. Prepare the roti. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and add the sesame seeds. Make a well in the centre and pour in the vegetable oil with the warm water. Stir and tip onto a clean work surface and knead for a few minutes until smooth. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave for 25–30 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, start on the curry. Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas 4. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil, add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. Place the aubergines on a roasting tray, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and toss together. Cook in the oven for 15–20 minutes or until soft.

3. In a casserole pot, heat the remaining oil over a medium heat. Add the shallots and cook gently for 5 minutes. Add the peppers, garlic and chilli and cook for 5 minutes. Stir through the spices and cook for a final minute. Add the potato and aubergine and pour over the coconut milk. Slowly bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove the chilli, then stir through the pineapple, peanut butter, lime juice, coriander and seasoning.

4. Divide the roti dough in to 8 and roll out into rounds on a lightly floured surface. Heat a non-stick griddle pan over a medium heat until almost smoking. Add the floured roti to the pan, one at a time. Cook for 2 minutes on each side or until puffed up and slightly charred. Serve the curry with the warm rotis, topped with toasted coconut flakes and extra lime wedges.
