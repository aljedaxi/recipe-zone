Rehydrate TVP by adding it to a medium bowl and covering with warm water. Cover with a lid or plate and let it soak for 10 minutes. Drain.

Peel and chop sweet potatoes into ½-inch cubes.

Empty entire can of chipotle peppers and finely chop until its nearly a paste. This adds quite a bit of heat, adjust to your heat preferences.

Rinse and drain beans.

Add all ingredients and spices to the slow cooker with the exception of the sweet corn. Mix well. Cook on low until sweet potatoes are tender, about 4-5 hours.

Stir in corn. Add salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm with cornbread.

Enjoy!
