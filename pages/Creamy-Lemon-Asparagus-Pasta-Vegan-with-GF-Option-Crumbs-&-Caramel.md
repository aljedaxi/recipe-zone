## 
1. Have all of your ingredients measured and ready to go before starting.
2. Prepare the pasta according to package directions, reserving one cup of cooking water.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the shallot, and asparagus. Saut√© for 2 -3 minutes, or until the asparagus starts to brighten in color. Add the snap peas, green peas and garlic, cooking for another 2 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, blend the cashews with the water until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Pour the cashew cream into the skillet with the vegetables, and stir until bubbling and it starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in the salt, lemon juice, lemon zest and nutritional yeast (or vegan Parmesan).
5. Remove from heat and toss with the cooked, drained noodles, stirring in reserved pasta water as necessary. Season with salt, pepper and red chili flakes if desired. Enjoy!

## Recipe Notes

To Reheat: Add a splash of water to leftovers during reheating to help reconstitute the sauce. Leftover pasta will absorb some of the moisture, so adding more water during reheating makes it a bit saucier.
