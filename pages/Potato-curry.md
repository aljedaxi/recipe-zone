## 
1. Add the garlic and onion to a non-stick saucepan and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Add a splash of water if it starts to stick to keep this recipe oil-free. Then, add the tomato paste and sauté for 1 minute more to coat.
2. Add the fresh tomatoes and press them down gently. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, until the tomatoes start to release their juices.
3. Add the potatoes, coconut milk, curry powder, turmeric and garam masala. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook on a low-medium heat, stirring occasionally, for around 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.
4. At the last minute, stir in the spinach and the green peas, cooking until the spinach has wilted. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve over a bed of rice of your choice.
