This hearty vegetarian curry with sweet potato and red lentil is an easy midweek meal that can easily be made vegan too.

This warming curry is brought together by the red lentils, which become thick and creamy as they cook. This can be made in advance and frozen in batches if you wish.

1. Heat the oil in a large deep pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes until beginning to soften. Add the garlic, chilli flakes, garam masala, ground coriander, cumin and turmeric. Fry for 3–4 minutes, stirring now and again, until aromatic.

2. Add the sweet potatoes, lentils, coconut milk and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30–35 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the lentils from sticking, until the sweet potatoes and lentils are cooked through.

3. Add the spinach to the pan and cook for 5 minutes until wilted down. Stir in the lemon juice and season to taste with up to a teaspoon of salt and a grinding of black pepper.

4. Serve with rice, a dollop of yoghurt and coriander leaves scattered over.
