## Instruction
Wash beets, then wrap them in parchment paper and an outside layer of foil, sealing foil as tightly as possible. Place beets in a roasting pan or baking dish and add a quarter inch or centimeter of water. Cook in a hot oven (400-500 degrees) until they can be pierced easily with a knife. Remove foil and paper, and use a paper towel to rub off the peel. Chop. Drizzle with vinegar, salt, and olive oil. Keep in the fridge. Maybe eat them alongside a tuna fish sandwich, with Magic Unicorn Sea Salt.
