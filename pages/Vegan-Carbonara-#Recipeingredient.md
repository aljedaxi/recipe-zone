## Tofu Bacon
1. In a large bowl, whisk the tamari, vinegar, liquid smoke, smoked paprika, and garlic together. Set aside.
2. Cut the pressed tofu into 1/4" cubes and add them to the bowl of marinade. Gently toss to coat well. Let the cubes marinate for 10-15 minutes (or longer).
3. Heat a Large Non-Stick Pan over medium heat. Now add the oil, and when it's hot, add the cubed tofu (don't pour in the marinade). Cook until browned and slightly crispy on all sides, stirring occasionally. It should take about 7-9 minutes. Lower the heat if needed to prevent burning. Remove from heat and place in a bowl. Wipe out the pan.
## Vegan Carbonara
1. In a large bowl, whisk the soy milk, liquid smoke, cornstarch, nutritional yeast, lemon, vinegar, miso paste, black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon black salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil until smooth. Set aside.
2. Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until just shy of al dente (according to package instructions).
3. Start cooking the sauce when there are 5-6 minutes left on the pasta cook time. Heat the same large skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the remaining oil and wait until it shimmers. Now add the shallots and sauté until translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Now add the garlic and sauté until fragrant and lightly golden, about 30-60 seconds.
4. Whisk the sauce again and add it to the pan. Cook until it thickens slightly for about 2-4 minutes. If the pasta isn't finished, just lower the heat on the sauce or remove it for a minute. Taste for seasoning and add more if needed.
5. When the pasta is done, reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and drain. Add pasta to the skillet and stir to coat. Add just a 1/4 cup of pasta water and cook down until creamy and noodles are coated, about 1-2 minutes (add more pasta water if needed). Fold in the tofu bacon, but reserve some for topping each dish. Remove from heat, then sprinkle the remaining black salt and stir gently to combine. If preferred, add fresh-cut parsley, black pepper, and vegan parmesan. Enjoy!

## Recipe Notes

TOFU: wrap a block of tofu in a dish towel and place it on a rimmed plate. Add a cast iron skillet on top (or something equally heavy)and let it drain for 20-30 minutes. Pat dry to remove excess moisture on the surface. You can also use a Tofu Press to make it even easier or you can use Pre-Pressed Tofu or High-Protein Tofu.
Prep time doesn't include pressing the tofu. 
I prefer to press the whole block of tofu and save the rest for a different recipe or make extra tofu bacon. It lasts in the fridge for 4-5 days and I use it for salads, casseroles, tacos, wraps, or straight-up snacking. It's delicious! If you do this too, just double the marinade. 
I highly recommend a Non-Stick Skillet for the tofu bacon or a well-seasoned Cast Iron Pan. The tofu sticks easily to the pan and can burn. If you use a stainless-steel pan, just make sure the pan is well heated and oiled before beginning. Watch carefully and stir often.
Instead of frying, you can bake the tofu cubes at 400 F (200 C) for 20-30 minutes until browned and slightly crispy. Line a large baking pan with parchment paper and spray with oil. Move the crumbles around every 7-10 minutes for even browning.
BLACK SALT: it adds a subtle 'eggy' smell and flavor to the dish. I highly recommend trying it at least once. If you're not into 'eggy' flavor, you can just use regular salt instead. It will still be delicious! 
Nutritional information: it includes all of the marinade ingredient amounts. However, a lot of the marinade will be left behind, which will make some of the values lower.
