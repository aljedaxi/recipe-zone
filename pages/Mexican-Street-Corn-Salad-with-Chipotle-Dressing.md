## 
1. Dice the red bell pepper and the avocado. Cut the green onions into rings and roughly chop the fresh cilantro.
2. Combine the corn, the red bell pepper, the green onions, and the avocado in a large bowl. If you want to make an authentic Mexican street corn salad, use grilled corn instead of boiled corn. You could also cook it in a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes.Â But for a quicker version, I'd recommend boiled corn. Either frozen or fresh.
3. Combine the vegan mayonnaise, the lime juice, the smoked paprika, the cumin, and the chipotle sauce and whisk until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the corn salad.
4. Stir in the chopped fresh cilantro and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.
5. In a small bowl, crumble the firm tofu with your hands. Stir in the vegan mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper.
6. Sprinkle the crumbled tofu on top of the salad and serve immediately.
