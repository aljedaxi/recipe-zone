# SOAKED OVERNIGHT OATS

A slight variation on the basic technique for soaking grains can produce a convenient, delicious, nutrient-dense breakfast. Prepare a batch of overnight oats whenever you have a chance and store them in the refrigerator for a no-hassle breakfast or snack.

## Ingredients
- 1½ cups rolled oats (preferably sprouted, see here)
- 1½ cups kefir, raw milk clabber, or yogurt
- 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup, raw honey, or unrefined sugar (such as Sucanat or muscovado)
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut
- ¾ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Pinch sea salt

## Instructions

In a medium bowl, mix all the ingredients. Pack the mixture into four glass jars and cover. Place the jars on the counter or in a cabinet at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours. The soaked oats can be eaten immediately or transferred to the refrigerator for a few days. These are delicious cold, so an ideal schedule would be to mix this up before you go to work in the morning, let it sit on the counter during the day, and transfer it to the fridge when you return home from work at the end of the day. That way, they are ready to go when you wake up in the morning.

Note:
If using “porridge” oats, add an additional ¾ cup kefir, milk clabber, or yogurt, because they absorb more moisture.

What to do with leftovers?
Dehydrate them! Spread out the leftover oat mixture on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and place in your oven at its lowest setting (for most of us that is 170°F) for several hours, until fully dehydrated and brittle. Remove from the oven, break into smaller pieces, and store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 months. There are numerous ways you can use these dried, soaked, sweetened oats, including as a base for Cricket Granola (here).

For Chocolate Overnight Oats:
To the above master recipe, add 4½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder and omit the vanilla.

For Citrus Overnight Oats:
To the above master recipe, add the grated zest and juice of 1 lemon, lime, or orange.

For Hot Porridge:
Make the overnight oats as in the master recipe, but instead of eating them cold, add ½ cup milk and warm them in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through and the liquid is absorbed to the desired consistency.

## Appendix: Sprouting Grains

Obtain high-quality, preferably organic whole grains that have not been processed in a way that would prohibit them from sprouting. They need the hull and germ, bran, and endosperm. Pearled, parched, split, rolled, or chopped grains will not work. In other words, the grains must be dormant, but alive. Sprouted grains can used as toppings on dishes such as salad and are fantastic when incorporated into dough for Airfield Sourdough Bread (see here).

Place the grains in a large jar. Do not fill more than one-third of the jar, as the grains will expand to approximately three times their original size.

Secure a layer of cheesecloth or porous material around the rim with a rubber band or other fastener. You need something that is porous enough to allow water to pass through, but fine enough to keep the grains behind.

Fill the jar with warm water, swirl to mix, then strain out the water. Fill the jar once again with warm water, leaving about 1 inch of headspace. Allow the grains to soak overnight to prepare them for sprouting.

The next day, invert the jar, drain the grains, refill with warm water, swirl to mix, invert again to drain, and prop the jar upside down at an angle in a bowl so it continues to drain.

Continue to rinse and drain twice a day until the sprouts are between ⅛ and ¼ inch long. It should take anywhere from one to five days depending on the grain and the temperature of the room. We want to fool the grains into letting down their defenses, to deactivate the phytic acid, start to convert the complex carbohydrates, and begin to sprout. However, we want to stop the process at the ideal point—the point at which the grain is safe and digestible, but before it puts too much energy into the production of new life.

At this point the grains can be used right away, or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
