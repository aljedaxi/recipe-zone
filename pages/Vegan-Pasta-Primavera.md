## 
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente according to the package directions. 2 minutes before the pasta is done cooking, add the asparagus.
2. When the pasta and asparagus are done, drain them together into a colander. Return them to the pot and toss with a dash of olive oil.
3. While the pasta cooks, coat the bottom of a large pot with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and place it over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and carrot. Sauté for about 8 minutes, until the carrot begins to soften.
4. Add the garlic and sauté 1 minute more, until very fragrant.
5. Add the wine, coconut milk, lemon juice, zucchini and sun-dried tomatoes. Simmer for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini softens and the alcohol has cooked off.
6. Stir in the peas, and then add the pasta and asparagus to the pot. Toss a few times to distribute the veggies, then remove the pot from heat.
7. Stir in the basil and parsley, then season with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.
8. Divide onto plates and serve.
