# Lentil Minestrone

Lentils add a hearty note to a minestrone soup made with zucchini and kale. A combination of both dried and canned tomatoes gives the broth complex tomato flavor without any additional salt or spices. Quinoa is recommended as a gluten-free alternative to pasta. For extra oomph, swirl some Basil Pesto into each bowl at the table.
