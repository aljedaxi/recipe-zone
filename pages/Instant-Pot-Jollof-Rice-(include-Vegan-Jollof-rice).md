2. Set the instant pot to sautee then add vegetable oil in the inner pot of the instant pot then add chopped onions and tomato puree.  Fry the onion and tomato puree for 2 minutes. (make sure you keep stirring to avoid burning).
3. Add in 1 cup of pepper mix, curry powder, thyme and white pepper. Fry for another 2 minutes.
4. Put off sautee mode of the instant pot.
5. Wash rice with warm water till water runs clear.
6. Add broth, sliced tomato, bayleaf, salt and washed rice in the instant pot. Stir and cover instant pot with lid and set valve to sealing (ensure bottom of IP is deglazed to avoid burn error).
7. Set instant pot to manual pressure cook 8 minutes and after pressure cooking, do a 10 minutes naturally pressure release.
8. When instant pot is depressurised, open the lid. Sauce will be settled on the rice, stir the sauce in the rice and jollof rice is ready to be enjoyed.

## Recipe Notes

Once rice goes in the sauce, give it a good stir before pressure cooking. This is to avoid the sauce settling at the bottom and causing burn error.
Omit or increase scotchbonnet in the pepper mix to suit your taste.
Use vegetable stock/bouillion and vegetable broth for vegan jollof rice.
Bouillion cubes usually used in Nigerian cooking is maggi cubes.
