# Amazing Sauerkraut

*fermented, eat like a human*

**1 Gallon**

---

## Ingredients

- 2 heads cabbage
- 1 sour apple, peeled if desired, cored & thinly sliced
- 1/2 onion
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds
- 2 or 3 juniper berries
- sea salt

---

1. Remove & set aside the outermost leaves of the cabbage
2. Wash the remaining cabbage and remove the core; shred the cabbage
3. Place the cabbage, apple, onion, bay leaf, caraway seeds, and juniper berries.
4. Add 2% of the total weight of ingredients worth of salt. *Deeply*, *thoroughly* massage the salt into the ingredients.
5. Transfer the mixture & liquid into your fermentation vessel. Pack it tightly. Leave at least 2 inches at the top for expansion. The liquid must over all solids, while leaving 1 inch of air.
6. Place the large leaves atop the kraut, and a weight atop the large leaves.
7. Lid the vessel. Place it somewhere, ideally around 16c. Takes about a week to be "fermented", & u can keep it going for several weeks. Once you like the flavour, fridge it.
