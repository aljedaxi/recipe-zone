## 
1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30-60 seconds.
2. Add the spices and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
3. Add the drained chickpeas and crushed tomatoes and simmer 5 minutes.

5. Stir in the lime juice and cilantro. Serve over cauliflower or basmati rice with more chopped cilantro for garnish.

## Recipe Notes

Note 1: I prefer crushed tomatoes in this recipe, because it's a nice middle ground between chunky diced tomatoes and super smooth tomato sauce. You can use either diced tomatoes or tomato sauce if you can't find crushed tomatoes.
Note 2: I highly, highly recommend using unsweetened coconut cream in this recipe, as it enriches this recipe beautifully. However, you can use regular coconut milk, if you prefer. Try to not use light coconut milk, though, as it will not produce the richness that makes this recipe so good!
