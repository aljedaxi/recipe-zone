## 
1. Heat a large skillet and a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot add a dash of olive or coconut oil to the large skillet, then the onion and peppers. Season generously with salt, cumin and garlic powder.
2. Cook until softened and slightly caramelized, stirring often. Set aside and cover to keep warm.
3. At the same time, add a dash of oil to the medium pan. Then add the mushrooms. Season with a bit of salt and once softened and brown (see photo), add a dash of A1 (vegan-friendly) for more flavor (optional). Remove from heat, set aside and cover.
4. Prepare guacamole by adding avocados to a bowl then adding lime juice and a generous pinch of salt. Fresh cilantro and onion are optional.
5. Warm tortillas in the microwave or oven and you’re ready to go. Serve tortillas with peppers and onions, mushrooms, guacamole, and any other toppings you desire such as salsa, hot sauce, and cheese or sour cream (for non-vegan).
